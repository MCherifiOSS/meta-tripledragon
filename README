This is my first try at creating a BSP layer for the
Tripledragon DBS-3000 Set-Top-Box.

This is intended to be used with the daisy branch of
git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
Unfortunately, it is not trivial to build old eglibc-2.16
(which is the latest version that supports kernel 2.6.12)
on newer releases, so meta-tripledragon is stuck at daisy
for now.

Have a lot of fun...
